# Titans

There are a total of 9 titans in this pack, each with unique abilities, and some with variations influencing its skin and stats.

## Universal Abilities
### **These abilities are shared by every Titan Shifter.**
* ### Titan Shifting
All Titan Shifters possess the power to turn into a titan (duh) which varies in size, speed, strength, and special abilities.
* ### Self-Stab
All Shifters need to sustain at least a minor injury in order to shift, so they are all capable of cutting themselves with a sword when they are holding one in their main hand.
* ### Pure Immunity
As a Titan Shifter, you are unable to be turned into a [Pure Titan](./titans/pure.md).
* ### Insufficient Nutrients
In titan form, you won't gain much value from eating measly human food. Instead, consuming (killing) mobs is a much better way to eat.
* ### Skeletal Remains
Upon emerging from your titan form, a disintegrating skeleton will be left behind in place of your spent titan's body.
* ### Titan Marks
After untransforming, all Titan Shifters will gain marks on their face, just below their eyes. The intensity of the marks depends on how much they've used their titan. Each titan has a different marking shape.
* ### Force Ejection
In titan form, being at or below 3 hunger bars will force eject you, making you sustain minor drawbacks of overuse. Additionally, dying (only if the damage taken is or is less than 8 hearts) will eject you out of your titan body, inflicting negative effects and lowering your energy.
* ### Stats
In the description of each titan, you can find details on their specific stats (more details in-game).
* ### Smoke Indication
As a Titan Shifter, your smoke and electricity emissions are a great indicator to the status of your body's health, both human and titan forms (more details in-game).
