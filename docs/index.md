# Titan Shifter Megapack

<br>

This is a datapack for the Origins mod adding all 9 [titans](./titans.md) from [Attack on Titan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Titan) to Minecraft.

This datapack is for Fabric, and it requires [Origins](https://modrinth.com/mod/origins/), [Apugli](https://modrinth.com/mod/apugli/), [Appli](https://github.com/ThePhantomPig791/Appli), and [Pehkui](https://modrinth.com/mod/pehkui/).
