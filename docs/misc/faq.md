## Frequently Asked Questions

### "Is there a config?"
Yes! See [Configuration](./config.md) for the in-game config. Here, you can modify a bunch of aspects of the pack, including enabling and disabling specific titans and abilities.

### "When will <update/release/whatever> come out?"
I usually don't like to give myself deadlines because they just add pressure and therefore stress â€” you're welcome to try to gauge when something will release based on teasers, but please just don't try to push your imagined estimated release date on me.

### "Can I steal someone else's titan?"
Yes! See [Titan Stealing](./titan_stealing.md).

### "Titan hardening really clutters my world, how can I remove it?"
Just drop one TNT and one sugar on top of any hardened structure to quickly remove it.

### "Forge?"
Unlikely, as it would be rather difficult to port Appli (the pack's library mod) to a modloader I've never developed in before.

### "How can I change a titan's skin?"
If you want to, just unzip the pack, open the shifting power of your choice, and replace the image link (search for "git" in the power since the assets are hosted on github).

### "How do I give myself permanent [Royal Blood](./royal_blood.md)?"
You can enable this in the config; you won't see the usual RB bar or gain the status effects, but you'll be able to use the powers as if you had it active.

### "Help! I can't use the warhammer's warhammer to actually attack anything with better combat installed!"
Use an older version of better combat, a recent change broke Pehkui compat (the mod that makes your reach longer).

### "What's the key to scream as the beast / transform pures as the founding / etc?"
It's the "Highlight Players (spectator)" key under the "Miscellaneous" category in controls. It's unbound by default.
