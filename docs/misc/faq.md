## Frequently Asked Questions

### "When will <update/release/whatever> come out?"
I usually don't like to give myself deadlines because they just add pressure and therefore stress â€” you're welcome to try to gauge when something will release based on teasers, but please don't try to push your imagined estimated release date on me.

### "Titan hardening really clutters my world, how can I remove it?"
Just drop one TNT and one sugar on top of any hardened structure to quickly remove it.

### "Forge?"
Unlikely, as it would be rather difficult to port Appli (the pack's library mod) to a modloader I've never developed in before.

### "How can I change a titan's skin?"
If you want to, just unzip the pack, open the shifting power of your choice, and replace the image link (search for "git" in the power since the assets are hosted on github).

### "How do I give myself permanent [Royal Blood](./royal_blood.md)?
You can set up a repeating command block in a spawn/forceloaded chunk that runs the command `/resource set <username> phantom:shifter/<titan>_shift_royal_blood 0` (then turn off command feedback with `/gamerule commandBlockOutput false` so your chat isn't flooded).
